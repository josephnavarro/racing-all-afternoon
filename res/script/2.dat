SCENE: LEFT = 2, BGM = 5, SCENE = 1
Yosuke
Phew... What a race! I'm beat. But wait a minute...
This place looks familiar. All this driving took
us pretty far, didn't it?
SCENE: RIGHT = 4
Chie
I'll say... We're nowhere near where we're supposed
to be! Izanami isn't waiting for us in Kanji's
bathhouse!
SCENE: LEFT = 5
Kanji
Hey! Don't call it "my" bathhouse! I didn't ask for
this place! It just popped up one day, all right?

SCENE: RIGHT = 3
Yukiko
Careful, Kanji-kun. If you deny your other self
again, don't you think it might come back?

SCENE: LEFT = 2
Yosuke
Wh-whoah, wait a minute! Is that really how it works?
Kanji, snap out of it! I don't want to see your
Shadow again!
SCENE: RIGHT = 5
Kanji
Geez, calm down. Nothing's gonna happen... And wait,
what's wrong with me doing what I want to do?

SCENE: LEFT = 2
Yosuke
Ack! Don't say it all creepy like that! Okay, never
mind, just keep denying your other self!

SCENE: RIGHT = 5
Kanji
Dude, make up your mind! Besides, even if that
other me shows up again, we're just gonna beat
it to a pulp, like usual.
SCENE: LEFT = 12
Akihiko
Hold on. What's this talk about Shadow selves?


SCENE: RIGHT = 6
Naoto
Ah, right. You're Persona users like us. In this
world, an individual's Shadow manifests when
they're thrown inside the TV.
SCENE: LEFT = 7
Teddie
Shadows are born from human emotions, and they
get angry when rejected! But if a human accepts
their other self, it becomes their Bear-sona!
SCENE: RIGHT = 12
Akihiko
I see. So it has nothing to do with the Lost or the
Dark Hour.

SCENE: LEFT = 1
Yu
If you don't mind my asking, what's this Dark Hour
you keep referring to?

SCENE: RIGHT = 12, BGM = 6
Akihiko
You have Personas, but you've never heard of the
Dark Hour? I guess I should tell you, then.

SCENE: RIGHT = 12
Akihiko
It's a hidden hour that occurs at midnight. During
this time, a building called Tartarus appears where
Gekkoukan High is supposed to be.
SCENE: LEFT = 13
Mitsuru
In our world, Tartarus is where most Shadows tend
to congregate. But, according to your story, it
seems this world has plenty of them, too.
SCENE: RIGHT = 12
Akihiko
Where we come from, Shadows are monsters that
appear during the Dark Hour. There used to be
larger ones that showed up every full moon...
SCENE: LEFT = 13
Mitsuru
...But we were manipulated into destroying them.


SCENE: RIGHT = 4
Chie
Manipulated? You make it sound like getting rid
of the Shadows is a bad thing.

SCENE: LEFT = 13
Mitsuru
In our situation, it was. The Shadows that appeared
each full moon were pieces of a greater entity,
all longing to be reunited.
SCENE: RIGHT = 10
Yukari
My father belonged to a research group that exper-
imented on Shadows. His colleagues were determined
to bring about the Fall, or the end of humanity.
SCENE: LEFT = 13
Mitsuru
As was my father. Together, they amassed Shadows
into that being... The being called Death.

SCENE: RIGHT = 9
Minato
Takeba's father disagreed with the group's ideals,
so he found a way to split Death into twelve pieces.

SCENE: LEFT = 11
Junpei
And from what I understand, our defeating each full
moon Shadow only put them back together, like one
big jigsaw puzzle.
SCENE: RIGHT = 5
Kanji
...That's a lot to take in.


SCENE: LEFT = 12
Akihiko
We don't expect you to understand it all. Just know
that you and I have similar enemies.

SCENE: RIGHT = 6
Naoto
So now that Death has been restored, it threatens
to bring an end to your world. Is that correct?

SCENE: LEFT = 18
Fuuka
Yes, that's right. It is the Fall that we are
trying to prevent.

SCENE: RIGHT = 15, BGM = 0
Shinjiro
...Agh!!


SCENE: LEFT = 9
Minato
... ...!


SCENE: RIGHT = 11
Junpei
... ...!


SCENE: LEFT = 12
Akihiko
...Shinji! What's the matter?


SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
Shit... My head... It feels like it's splitting
in two...

SCENE: LEFT = 12
Akihiko
Dammit, don't tell me your Persona's acting up
again! Where are your suppressants?

SCENE: RIGHT = 7, BGM = 9
Teddie
I hate to interrupt you guys, but I sense some
Shadows approaching!

SCENE: LEFT = 18
Fuuka
I sense them, too! A lot of them!


SCENE: RIGHT = 1
Yu
I guess this is where we make our stand!


SCENE: LEFT = 14
Aigis
Negative. With one of us injured, we are at a
severe disadvantage. I too detect the presence
of over a hundred Shadows.
SCENE: RIGHT = 1
Yu
Over a hundred...?!


SCENE: LEFT = 12
Akihiko
Let's cut the chitchat and get out of here!
Shinji's hurting enough as it is!

SCENE: RIGHT = 2
Yosuke
I have an idea! Let's get in those go-karts Teddie
made! We can lose the Shadows if we go through
the bathhouse!
SCENE: LEFT = 1
Yu
You sound rather eager. You sure you're not a fan
of the sauna?

SCENE: RIGHT = 2
Yosuke
Hey, c'mon, partner, don't be like that! I-It's
the steam! It'll mask our scent!

SCENE: LEFT = 1
Yu
Uh-huh. Anyway, I'll race you there.


SCENE: RIGHT = 2
Yosuke
Man, you were ready to fight just a second ago!
How can you stay cool at a time like this?

RACE = 1,0,2,4,13,11
