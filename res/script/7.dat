Teddie
Shinji...


SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
...Hm? What do you want now? It's all over.
The others have disappeared already. I'm just
waiting for my turn.
SCENE: LEFT = 7
Teddie
Well, I just wanted to say something before...
You know...

SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
Then spit it out, will ya? Time's in short supply.


SCENE: LEFT = 7, BGM = 14
Teddie
I know we've only just met... But we're the same,
aren't we? We're both Shadows.

SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
Wait, seriously? You're...


SCENE: LEFT = 7
Teddie
That's right! I used to be a regular Shadow a long
time ago. And then one day, I gained emotions.

SCENE: LEFT = 7
Teddie
After that, I tried forgetting about my past as a
Shadow. But sooner or later, it came back to
me... For a while, I was scared.
SCENE: LEFT = 7
Teddie
But Sensei helped me move on! He showed me that I
could make a change in the human world, even if
I was just a Shadow!
SCENE: LEFT = 7
Teddie
That's why I'm here now... I want to help you,
Shinji, like Sensei helped me!

SCENE: LEFT = 7
Teddie
You can come with us to the human world. I'll show
you Junes, and we can eat ramen, and pick on
Yosuke, and go to the beach, and-
SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
...Sorry, but I'll pass.


SCENE: LEFT = 7
Teddie
...Huh? Why?


SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
I appreciate the offer, but I'd rather just
disappear. I shouldn't exist anymore, and
especially not in that world.
SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
My true self died a long time ago. I'm nothing
more than a memory. A memory of a dead man.

SCENE: LEFT = 7
Teddie
Oh, I see...


SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
...But I'll tell you what.


SCENE: LEFT = 7
Teddie
...!


SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
Don't forget what you saw today. Don't forget the
fun you had, the people you met... Even if they
weren't really people to begin with.
SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
Just hope that someday, somewhere along the line,
in that other world...

SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
...Hope that you'll meet one of us. The real us.


SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
Naturally, don't go looking for me. I won't be
there to greet you.

SCENE: LEFT = 7
Teddie
I know. Thank you, Shinji.


SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
Well, you can leave now. You got what you wanted,
right?

SCENE: LEFT = 7
Teddie
Not quite.


SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
Then what more do you want?


SCENE: LEFT = 7
Teddie
Ta-dah! Look at these! I made these go-karts
special! Just for the two of us!

SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
Oh, I get it. You want to race one more time, eh?


SCENE: LEFT = 7
Teddie
I-I mean... I-If you don't mind, that is.


SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
Haha, all right, then. But just this once. I
guarantee I won't show up the next time you
look for me.
SCENE: LEFT = 7
Teddie
Woohoo! That makes me bear-y happy!


RACE = 14,14
