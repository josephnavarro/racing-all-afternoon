Yu
It's been a long year, but we've finally found the 
real culprit. Who would've thought it was that gas
station attendant? Talk about random.
SCENE: RIGHT = 2
Yosuke
I'd have never guessed. But anyway, partner, let's 
go kick some ass! Just gather up your top three
party members as usual.
SCENE: RIGHT = 2
Yosuke
Of course, knowing you, you'll pick me, Yukiko, and
Chie. After all, we're the original four! Been
through this since the beginning and all.
SCENE: LEFT = 5
Kanji
Hey, wait a minute! Why does Yosuke over here get to
call the shots? Senpai, you'll let me fight this
Izanami asshole, won't ya?
SCENE: RIGHT = 1
Yu
Wait, it's not like that... I mean, um...


SCENE: LEFT = 3
Yukiko
Kanji-kun, I'm sorry, but we can't bring five people
to battle all at once. It's against the rules.

SCENE: RIGHT = 5
Kanji
Wait... Really? I don't remember having rules
around here, but if you say so, it can't be helped.
I'll just take Yosuke's place. No hard feelings.
SCENE: LEFT = 4
Chie
Kanji! She's kidding! There's no rules like
that! ...Although now that you mention it, we've
always tackled the TV world four at a time...
SCENE: RIGHT = 6
Naoto
So it's settled. Kanji, Yukiko-san, and I will go
with Senpai to take on Izanami. Simple as that.

SCENE: LEFT = 1
Yu
I'm so confused.


SCENE: RIGHT = 2
Yosuke
Partner, you're not going to listen to them, are you?
Just bring me and Naoto-kun and Teddie, since the
others are... Hey, wait a minute, where's Rise?
SCENE: LEFT = 1
Yu
Oh yeah, didn't she tell you? She said she had to go
do some preparations for... "Dancing all night," or
something. Didn't know what she meant.
SCENE: RIGHT = 4
Chie
Sounds like a waste of time. But I guess we can't talk,
since wasting time is what we're doing right now!
C'mon, Yu, just pick your team already!
SCENE: LEFT = 1
Yu
Sigh... I didn't sign up for this. Hey, Teddie, wanna
come with? Let's just get this done already.

SCENE: RIGHT = 7
Teddie
Hold on, you guys! I smell something fishy! We can't
go just yet!

SCENE: LEFT = 14, BGM = 6
???
Suspicious individuals detected. Shall we engage
in combat?

SCENE: LEFT = 9
???
No, let them be. Maybe they have answers.


SCENE: RIGHT = 1
Yu
Hold on... I've got some questions for you, myself.
Who are you, and how'd you get inside the TV?

SCENE: LEFT = 9
???
...TV? ...What TV? We came here through Tartarus.
But let me ask you this... How are you awake
during the Dark Hour?
SCENE: RIGHT = 1
Yu
Dark Hour? Tartarus? Okay, now I'm really
confused.

SCENE: LEFT = 9, BGM = 7
Minato
Let me clear up some of that confusion. The name's
Minato. The girl over there's Aigis. And since you're
conscious, I assume you know what a Persona is.
SCENE: RIGHT = 1
Yu
Other Persona users? Well, I can't say I trust you yet,
but at least we have common ground. Are there any
more of you?
SCENE: LEFT = 11
Junpei
Junpei Iori, reporting for duty! Who's the man? I'm
the man! Home run!

SCENE: RIGHT = 10
Yukari
I'm sorry about that. Just ignore him. Oh yeah,
my name's Yukari. Nice to meet you. 

SCENE: LEFT = 11
Junpei
Hey, no need to be like that! I was just being
friendly! Wait... I think I've said that before.

SCENE: RIGHT = 12
Akihiko
All right, enough. Let's just get this over with.
The name's Akihiko. And the others are Mitsuru,
Shinji, Fuuka, and Ken.
SCENE: LEFT = 13
Mitsuru
The pleasure's all mine.


SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
Hmph.


SCENE: LEFT = 18
Fuuka
It's very nice to meet you all.


SCENE: RIGHT = 16
Ken
Pleased to meetcha.


SCENE: LEFT = 10
Yukari
There's one more. Say hi, Koromaru!


SCENE: RIGHT = 19
Koromaru
*Whine*


SCENE: LEFT = 9
Minato
Now do you trust us? We mean no harm. We only
want to get out of here. We're on a mission
of our own, just like you seem to be.
SCENE: RIGHT = 1
Yu
Fair enough. I suppose we'll tell you our names, as
well. I'm Yu Narukami, and these are my friends,
Yosuke, Chie, Yukiko, Teddie, Kanji, and Naoto.
SCENE: LEFT = 12
Akihiko
What's with the koala getup?


SCENE: RIGHT = 7
Teddie
Grrrr! How rude! I am not a koala, and this is not
a suit! I'm a bear! And this is real Teddie fur!

SCENE: LEFT = 18
Fuuka
...Right. Anyway, like Minato said, you appear to have
your own goals, so we'll not get in your way.

SCENE: RIGHT = 1
Yu
But you said you were lost, didn't you? We can't
just let you wander around the TV world. I
know you're Persona users, but...
SCENE: LEFT = 2
Yosuke
I know, why don't we just show them the exit?
Teddie, you can do that, can't you?

SCENE: RIGHT = 7
Teddie
It wouldn't be a very good idea. I don't know where
they came from, so a simple exit could take
them anywhere!
SCENE: LEFT = 6
Naoto
Not to mention, using the normal Junes exit would
be problematic. We don't even know if they're
from this region.
SCENE: RIGHT = 5
Kanji
So? We'll just buy 'em train tickets. They seem to
be in one group. Maybe they're headed in the same
direction.
SCENE: LEFT = 13
Mitsuru
I'm afraid it's not that simple. Long-distance
travel, in the worst case, could take hours.

SCENE: RIGHT = 4
Chie
What's the matter? Are you in that much of a
hurry to get home?

SCENE: LEFT = 13
Mitsuru
You could say that. Our mission must be completed
within the night, lest the world fall to ruin.

SCENE: RIGHT = 1, BGM = 8
Yu
... ...!


SCENE: LEFT = 13
Mitsuru
To stop the Fall... To defeat Nyx... This
is our burden. A burden that occurs at midnight,
when Tartarus appears.
SCENE: RIGHT = 14
Aigis
Pardon the interruption, but it is no longer the Dark
Hour. My internal clock indicates it is approx-
imately 1500 hours.
SCENE: LEFT = 12, BGM = 0
Akihiko
No way... We're too late?


SCENE: RIGHT = 14
Aigis
If my systems are to be believed, the current year
is 2012. And though I may be an imperfect machine,
my internal time is rarely incorrect.
SCENE: LEFT = 16
Ken
It can't be... We failed to stop it...?


SCENE: RIGHT = 18
Fuuka
But if that's true, how are we all...?
Two years should've passed, and yet...

SCENE: LEFT = 9
Minato
This certainly is a mystery. But since we haven't
gotten much help from these people, let's just
press onward.
SCENE: RIGHT = 7
Teddie
Wandering the TV world is a bad idea! Without a
guide, you'll get lost for sure!

SCENE: LEFT = 10
Yukari
If that's the case, what do you suggest?


SCENE: RIGHT = 7, BGM = 5
Teddie
A-hah! Don't you worry! I've been crafting things
in my spare time, and now I finally have the chance
to show them off! You're gonna love this!
SCENE: LEFT = 2
Yosuke
Just hurry up with it, will ya, Ted? We have a mission
of our own to complete, and it's got a deadline, too!

SCENE: RIGHT = 7
Teddie
...Right, heheh. Anyway, may I present to you...
Da-da-da-dah! ...Go-karts!

SCENE: LEFT = 4
Chie
... ...


SCENE: RIGHT = 13
Mitsuru
... ...


SCENE: LEFT = 3
Yukiko
... ...


SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
...I beg your pardon?


SCENE: LEFT = 7
Teddie
Didn't you hear me? I said... Go-karts! They're
Shadow-proof! Not to mention, they can speed
through the fog in no time at all!
SCENE: RIGHT = 3
Yukiko
...Pfft... Snort... Ahahahaha!


SCENE: LEFT = 15
Shinjiro
That wasn't that funny. Does she always do that?


SCENE: RIGHT = 9
Minato
Never mind that. At least it's something. But
we need to be sure that these work properly.

SCENE: LEFT = 1
Yu
Heh. We've only just met, but I can already tell
you speak my language.

SCENE: RIGHT = 5
Kanji
Don't tell me... Don't tell me you're gonna...


SCENE: LEFT = 6
Naoto
I wouldn't worry about it. A go-kart race, at
sufficiently high speeds, should take no more
than a minute or two to complete.
SCENE: RIGHT = 1
Yu
All right, team, who's with me? We're all going to
go for a spin with this Minato guy over here.
Just to make sure things are in order.
SCENE: LEFT = 9
Minato
It'll be my party versus yours. May the best team win.


SCENE: RIGHT = 7
Teddie
And with that being said... Let the race begin!


RACE = 0,8,1,9,3,10
