Chie
...Yukiko-chan? Teddie? Naoto-kun? Oh, great! All
this kart racing got everyone split up!

SCENE: RIGHT = 2
Yosuke
Hey, what about me? Aren't you worried whether
I'm okay?

SCENE: LEFT = 4
Chie
Why would anyone worry about you? Besides, I can
see you right there.

SCENE: RIGHT = 2
Yosuke
Geez, Chie, that's cold!


SCENE: LEFT = 4
Chie
Hey, don't take it so hard! I was just kidding.
But seriously, where are Yu and the others?

SCENE: RIGHT = 1
Yu
I'm right here. So is Kanji-kun.


SCENE: LEFT = 5
Kanji
The question is, where'd all those new guys head
off to?

SCENE: RIGHT = 9
Minato
I was able to keep up. Currently, we're missing
Mitsuru-san, Shinjiro-san, and Aigis.

SCENE: LEFT = 12
Akihiko
Dammit! We can't find Shinji?


SCENE: RIGHT = 4
Chie
Just as we were learning something about
him, too...

SCENE: LEFT = 11
Junpei
Hey, that's right. ...Minato-san! Didn't you say he
was dead? What was up with that?

SCENE: RIGHT = 9, BGM = 8
Minato
... ...


SCENE: LEFT = 10
Yukari
Minato-san... You've been acting strange since then.
Is there something you're hiding from us?

SCENE: RIGHT = 9
Minato
I've only told you as much as I can remember. I
don't even know why we're in this TV world.

SCENE: LEFT = 12
Akihiko
As much as you can remember? So what do you
remember, aside from Shinji's death?

SCENE: RIGHT = 9, BGM = 11
Minato
...Let's start from the beginning. All of us
here know what Nyx is, correct?

SCENE: LEFT = 10
Yukari
Right. And before we found ourselves here, we
were about to reach the top of Tartarus.

SCENE: RIGHT = 11
Junpei
Not to mention, Strega was done for. We defeated
Takaya, and Jin was swarmed by Shadows.

SCENE: LEFT = 12
Akihiko
That rings a bell, all right. But here's a question...
Do any of us remember anything before we climbed
Tartarus?
SCENE: RIGHT = 11
Junpei
...Before? What do you mean?


SCENE: LEFT = 12
Akihiko
We last entered Tartarus on January 31st. I'm asking
if anyone remembers what happened on the 30th.
Or the month of January, for that matter.
SCENE: RIGHT = 16
Ken
Of course I do! The day before, we... We were just...
That is, um...

SCENE: LEFT = 9
Minato
What are you getting at?


SCENE: RIGHT = 12, BGM = 0
Akihiko
Don't take my word for it, but I think someone's
been messing with our memories. Someone... Or
something.
SCENE: LEFT = 11
Junpei
... ...!


SCENE: RIGHT = 10
Yukari
... ...!


SCENE: LEFT = 12
Akihiko
Don't you see? Aside from Minato-san, none of us
knew Shinji was dead.

SCENE: LEFT = 12
Akihiko
I'll be honest, I denied it for a while, myself.
But our leader's never lied to us before.

SCENE: RIGHT = 11
Junpei
Um, hello? Shinjiro-san was walking, talking, and
breathing like the rest of us! I've never seen a
dead guy do that.
SCENE: LEFT = 12
Akihiko
Then explain the gaping bullet wound in his chest.


SCENE: RIGHT = 11
Junpei
... ...


SCENE: LEFT = 9
Minato
Akihiko-san's right. Something's not adding up. In the
very least, what we do know is that our memories are
all missing.
SCENE: RIGHT = 18
Fuuka
If only the others were here right now... Then we could
sort it out more easily.

SCENE: LEFT = 5, BGM = 5
Kanji
Hey, uh... Fuuka-san, was it? Didn't you say your
Persona could navigate? Can't you tell where the rest
of our group went?
SCENE: RIGHT = 18
Fuuka
I can only tell that they are quite a distance away.
I'm afraid I can't pinpoint their exact location.

SCENE: LEFT = 1
Yu
Dammit, if only Rise were here to help you out...
Or even Teddie.

SCENE: RIGHT = 4
Chie
Listen up, you guys! I say we go look for them! Get
in the go-karts, because we're going exploring!

SCENE: LEFT = 2
Yosuke
Come on, really? And don't say it, partner...


SCENE: RIGHT = 1
Yu
This calls for a race!
