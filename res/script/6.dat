SCENE: LEFT = 2, BGM = 5, SCENE = 8
Yosuke
Hey, what gives, Ted? This isn't Yukiko's castle!


SCENE: RIGHT = 7
Teddie
I know, I know. But I couldn't help myself! I
smelled something different, so I followed it!

SCENE: LEFT = 2
Yosuke
Different is right. I don't remember this being
in the TV world at all.

SCENE: RIGHT = 1
Yu
Me neither. What is this place?


SCENE: LEFT = 18, BGM = 0
Fuuka
It's... Tartarus.


SCENE: RIGHT = 1
Yu
... ...!


SCENE: LEFT = 14
Aigis
Fuuka-san's statement is correct. The look of this
area... It is unmistakably Tartarus.

SCENE: RIGHT = 15, BGM = 12
Shinjiro
I see you've found me.


SCENE: LEFT = 12
Akihiko
...Shinji! You're all right!


SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
Hmph. Why wouldn't I be? I'm at home here.


SCENE: LEFT = 10
Yukari
Huh? What are you saying, Shinjiro-san?


SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
Don't you get it already? What we've been looking
for all this time... It's not here.

SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
Our mission has long since ended.


SCENE: LEFT = 12
Akihiko
Talk straight, dammit! What are you getting at?


SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
This is the world of Shadows. Shadows are made of
raw instinct. They live to devour and kill. But at
their heart, they are born from human emotion.
SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
Sometimes, on rare occasion, a Shadow can awaken
to the very emotion it was born from, and take on
a less terrifying form.
SCENE: LEFT = 7
Teddie
That sounds just like me...


SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
Now, if a human's memories are strong enough, they
too can give rise to Shadows. Memories filled with
the pangs of grief and loss...
SCENE: LEFT = 9
Minato
... ...


SCENE: RIGHT = 15, BGM = 13
Shinjiro
I'll be blunt... The first time Mitsuru mentioned
Nyx, I had no idea what she was talking about.
Hell, I still don't.
SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
And when Minato-san started talking about the bullet
in my chest... That was a real shocker. Up to this
point I'd never even noticed it there.
SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
Any time you guys mentioned something I'd never
heard of, my head started to split. Not as bad
as my Persona trying to get me, but still.
SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
But in the back of my mind, I had a creeping
suspicion. So when the Shadows swarmed in
and you all ran... Well, I stayed behind.
SCENE: LEFT = 3
Yukiko
So that's why you weren't with us...!


SCENE: RIGHT = 12
Akihiko
Dammit, Shinji! The hell were you thinking?
Did you have a death wish?

SCENE: LEFT = 15
Shinjiro
Shut it, Aki. For one thing, I'm already dead. And
for another...

SCENE: LEFT = 15
Shinjiro
Those Shadows? ...They didn't lay a finger on me.
Not a single one of 'em.

SCENE: RIGHT = 10
Yukari
No... It can't be...


SCENE: LEFT = 15
Shinjiro
Well, you're back at Tartarus now. But if you
were following what I've been saying, you'd
know this isn't really Tartarus.
SCENE: RIGHT = 16
Ken
Then what is it?


SCENE: LEFT = 15
Shinjiro
You guys ever stop and wonder why your memories
seem to be messed up?

SCENE: LEFT = 15
Shinjiro
This TV world... It's nothing but a mirror. It
reflects the emotions of real people, as Teddie
said a little while ago.
SCENE: LEFT = 15
Shinjiro
What I'm trying to say is... We're not real people.


SCENE: LEFT = 15
Shinjiro
It sucked, finding out I was a Shadow.


SCENE: RIGHT = 11
Junpei
... ...!


SCENE: LEFT = 12
Akihiko
... ...!


SCENE: RIGHT = 14
Aigis
... ...


SCENE: LEFT = 13
Mitsuru
... ...!


SCENE: RIGHT = 18
Fuuka
... ...!


SCENE: LEFT = 16
Ken
... ...!


SCENE: RIGHT = 9
Minato
... ...!


SCENE: LEFT = 15, BGM = 13
Shinjiro
I don't know what emotions you guys came from,
but I can tell that the real Aki's been missing
me like hell. That's why I'm here.
SCENE: LEFT = 15
Shinjiro
I would hazard a guess that at least one more
of your real selves is dead, outside the TV. But
that's just a guess.
SCENE: RIGHT = 9
Minato
... ...


SCENE: LEFT = 15
Shinjiro
And I mean, think about it. If two years had
really passed, we'd all look older by now.

SCENE: RIGHT = 1
Yu
So you're all Shadows...


SCENE: LEFT = 2
Yosuke
Lingering emotions...


SCENE: RIGHT = 4
Chie
Emotions given shape and form...


SCENE: LEFT = 3
Yukiko
Wait... So if you're all someone's Shadows...
Does that mean your real selves were thrown in
here, too?
SCENE: RIGHT = 1
Yu
I hate to say it, but we have no way of finding that
out right now. We'll just have to see once we
get back to the real world.
SCENE: LEFT = 5
Kanji
Well then, when that time comes... We'll just
get 'em the hell out, like we always do!

SCENE: RIGHT = 2
Yosuke
One more thing I'm concerned about. Since you're
all someone's Shadows, does that mean we have to
fight you, too?
SCENE: LEFT = 15
Shinjiro
That won't be necessary. We'll disappear soon
enough. We have you to thank for that.

SCENE: RIGHT = 6
Naoto
... ...!


SCENE: LEFT = 15
Shinjiro
You made us question ourselves. You helped
us realize what we truly are... Shadows.
Nothing more.
SCENE: RIGHT = 7
Teddie
No, that's not true! You can be more than that!
You don't have to disappear!

SCENE: LEFT = 15
Shinjiro
Our existence was painful... We've been roaming
this TV world for a long time now, looking
for the top of Tartarus.
SCENE: LEFT = 15
Shinjiro
Funny thing is, we were never meant to find it.


SCENE: RIGHT = 9
Minato
He's right, you guys. We just have to accept this.
...The fact that we're only memories.

SCENE: LEFT = 10
Yukari
Somewhere out there, our real selves must be
grieving over a loss we don't even know yet.

SCENE: RIGHT = 11
Junpei
...A loss that we can never know.


SCENE: LEFT = 13
Mitsuru
... ...


SCENE: RIGHT = 19
Koromaru
*Whimper*


SCENE: LEFT = 1
Yu
So... What are you going to do now?


SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
Let's just enjoy the last moments of our
existence together, before we're gone
for good.
SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
...Let's have some fun.
