Yukiko
It seems the go-karts have taken us somewhere else
again... Somewhere I really don't want to be
right now.
SCENE: RIGHT = 4
Chie
I'm sorry, Yukiko. But I agree, we're not getting
any closer to completing our mission.

SCENE: LEFT = 2
Yosuke
Yeah, what gives, partner? Don't you think all this
racing is a waste of time?

SCENE: RIGHT = 1
Yu
Calm down. We had to get Shinjiro-san out of there
as fast as possible. And besides, wasn't using the
go-karts your idea, Yosuke?
SCENE: LEFT = 6
Naoto
Enough bickering. What's important is that we're
all okay.

SCENE: RIGHT = 10
Yukari
Shinjiro-san, are you all right?


SCENE: LEFT = 15
Shinjiro
Yeah, I'm good now.


SCENE: RIGHT = 6
Naoto
What intrigues me is that Akihiko-san mentioned
Persona suppressants. Would you mind elaborating
a little?
SCENE: LEFT = 12
Akihiko
Sometimes, people are unable to control their
Personas. The Persona gets violent and tries
to kill its host.
SCENE: RIGHT = 11
Junpei
Not too long ago, a friend of mine, Chidori, had
her Persona try and strangle her, so Shinjiro-san
gave her some pills.
SCENE: LEFT = 15, BGM = 0
Shinjiro
That's what usually happens. But that feeling I
had just now... That wasn't my Persona.

SCENE: RIGHT = 12
Akihiko
... ...!


SCENE: LEFT = 15, BGM = 10
Shinjiro
I'll be honest with you guys... I've never felt
my head splitting like that in my life.

SCENE: RIGHT = 16
Ken
Wait... Your Persona wasn't going berserk?


SCENE: LEFT = 15
Shinjiro
I know the difference between an enraged Persona
and a gaping hole in my memory.

SCENE: RIGHT = 18
Fuuka
...!

Naoto

SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
When you mentioned Death... What the hell was
that? You guys have never said anything like that
around me before.
SCENE: LEFT = 13
Mitsuru
Well, we... That is...


SCENE: RIGHT = 9
Minato
He's right. He wasn't with us when we learned about
the Fall. He wasn't even with us when Ryoji-san
came to Gekkoukan.
SCENE: LEFT = 15
Shinjiro
...Aagh!!


SCENE: RIGHT = 10, BGM = 0
Yukari
Minato-san... Do you know what's going on?


SCENE: LEFT = 9
Minato
I won't say I know everything. But I feel like I need
to mention something that's been bothering me
for a while.
SCENE: LEFT = 9
Minato
Haven't any of you stopped to question why Shinjiro-
san is with us? Don't you remember? ...He's dead.

SCENE: RIGHT = 16, BGM = 10
Ken
What? ...Dead?


SCENE: LEFT = 9
Minato
October 4. The full moon mission. He died taking
a bullet for you, Ken.

SCENE: RIGHT = 15

>Shinjiro opens his coat and looks at what appears
to be a bullet wound in his chest.

SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
... ...!!!


SCENE: LEFT = 16
Ken
... ...!


SCENE: RIGHT = 15
Shinjiro
No way... How the hell... What am I...?
...Argh!

SCENE: LEFT = 6
Naoto
... ...


SCENE: RIGHT = 12
Akihiko
Minato-san! Is there something you're not telling
us? As our leader, shouldn't you-

SCENE: LEFT = 13
Mitsuru
Quiet! Fighting won't get us anywhere!


SCENE: RIGHT = 14, BGM = 9
Aigis
Forgive the intrusion, but my sensors indicate
more Shadows approaching.

SCENE: LEFT = 2
Yosuke
Seriously? Why now?


SCENE: RIGHT = 3
Yukiko
Hey, I know! Let's escape through the castle!


SCENE: LEFT = 1
Yu
Race you there.


SCENE: RIGHT = 2
Yosuke
Again? Man, what's with you today?


RACE = 2,3,0,1,8,11
