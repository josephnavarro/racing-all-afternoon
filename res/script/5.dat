Kanji
Hey, this place looks familiar. Isn't this where
Naoto's Shadow...?

SCENE: RIGHT = 6
Naoto
Yes, it is. And it's about time you showed up.


SCENE: LEFT = 5
Kanji
...Agh! Hey, d-d-don't sneak up on me like that!


SCENE: RIGHT = 6
Naoto
I'm sorry, I couldn't resist. At any rate, are the
others with you?

SCENE: LEFT = 1
Yu
Yeah, we're all here. ...So this is where you've
been hiding, eh? Are you guys all right?

SCENE: RIGHT = 7
Teddie
Gasp! It's Sensei! I was so worried about you!
When we got separated, I was... I was just...
Waaaaahhhhh!
SCENE: LEFT = 4
Chie
Aw, don't cry, Teddie! It's okay, we're back
in one group, like we used to be.

SCENE: RIGHT = 13, BGM = 0
Mitsuru
Well, that's not entirely true. Tell me something...
Is Shinjiro-san with you?

SCENE: LEFT = 12, BGM = 8
Akihiko
... ...!


SCENE: RIGHT = 10
Yukari
... ...!


SCENE: LEFT = 9
Minato
You mean... He's not here?


SCENE: RIGHT = 13
Mitsuru
I see. This is troublesome. But no, when we became
separated, there were only five of us... Myself,
Aigis, Naoto-san, Teddie, and Yukiko-san.
SCENE: LEFT = 3
Yukiko
So you mean to say... Shinjiro-san is still missing?


SCENE: RIGHT = 2
Yosuke
...I'm afraid so. We thought he was with you guys.


SCENE: LEFT = 11
Junpei
Shit! Where could he be? He was still injured,
wasn't he?

SCENE: RIGHT = 7
Teddie
Not to mention, he shouldn't be able to see through
the fog! I don't remember giving any of you guys
my special Teddie glasses!
SCENE: LEFT = 6, BGM = 11
Naoto
...Wait a second. Both of you are correct. Not only is
Shinjiro-san unable to see through the TV world fog...

SCENE: LEFT = 6
Naoto
...But when we left him, he was also reeling from his
migraine. Under both of those conditions, he would
have been in no state to drive very far.
SCENE: RIGHT = 3
Yukiko
So what are you saying, Naoto-kun? Don't tell me you
think he's still back there?

SCENE: LEFT = 6
Naoto
I can't say for certain. But I suggest we return to
the castle to cover as much ground as possible.

SCENE: RIGHT = 7
Teddie
In that case, follow me! My sense of smell may not
be as sharp as before, but I know Yukiko's castle
like the back of my paw!
SCENE: LEFT = 5
Kanji
...Like the back of your paw?
